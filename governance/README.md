# AI Governance (Draft)

This directory defines the governance intent for Project Chimera.

## Principles

- Specifications are mandatory and authoritative.
- AI-generated code must align with ratified specs.
- High-impact actions require explicit review.
- Automation must fail closed when governance signals are missing.

## Current State

- Governance enforcement is declarative, not yet automated.
- CI validates the presence of specifications.
- Future iterations will introduce:
  - Spec alignment checks
  - Security review automation
  - AI-assisted code review with policy constraints

This document is intentionally minimal and will evolve as governance mechanisms mature.
