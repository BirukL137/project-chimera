# OpenClaw Integration Strategy

## Purpose
Enable Chimera agents to publish availability and status signals to the OpenClaw agent network.

## Planned Signals
- Agent availability (idle, busy, offline)
- Capability descriptors (content generation, trend analysis)
- Health status (degraded, healthy)

## Scope Limits
- No direct peer-to-peer agent execution
- No trust assumption between agents
- Informational signaling only (non-binding)
